Camera and Detection Calibration Tips:

1. Camera Placement:
   - Position the camera so it has a clear view of the goal area
   - Ensure consistent lighting to avoid shadows and reflections
   - Mount the camera securely to prevent movement

2. Ball Detection Tuning:
   If the ball is not being properly detected, adjust these parameters in the main script:
   
   # For white ball detection in different lighting conditions
   lower_white = np.array([0, 0, 200], dtype=np.uint8)  # Increase/decrease last value for different brightness
   upper_white = np.array([180, 30, 255], dtype=np.uint8)  # Adjust middle value for saturation tolerance
   
   # For size detection
   min_ball_radius = 10  # Increase if small white objects are being detected as the ball
   max_ball_radius = 30  # Increase if the ball appears larger in your camera view
   
   # For detection confidence
   ball_detection_confidence = 0.7  # Lower for more detections (may cause false positives)

3. Goal Area Selection:
   - Select a slightly larger area than the actual goal to account for detection margin
   - Make sure the corners are accurately positioned
